The purpose of this data generation is to scrape the top posts from the subreddit /r/EarthPorn
         and extract the locations of where the photographs were taken. This collection was done as part of an assignment
         for the Data Science class at RPI but was inspired by curiosity and exploration. Source code for the script used to collect data can be found in the refereces section. Required dependencies
         and their versions can also be found in the refereces section.",
